# Eye Into AI (Our AI GWAP)

## First Time Setup

Before running/deploying, make sure you have configured the .env file in the 'frontend' directory.  The .env has not been committed to git, but can be found in our shared google drive.

In the 'frontend' directory, you can then run:

### `npm install`

### `firebase login`

### `firebase init`

Select Emualtors then select Firestore, Database, Hosting, and Authentication emulators

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `gcloud app deploy`

This will deploy it to our google cloud.

### `npm run deploy`

This will deploy the frontend to Github Pages. You must be in the frontend directory for this to work.
